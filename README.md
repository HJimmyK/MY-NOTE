This is a note I wrote using Obsidian, which includes the complete Obsidian library of styles, themes, plugins, and more that I have used. 
This is for learning purposes only and has no other purpose or profit. 
If you like it, I would also be very grateful.

### note
1. _obsidian file is my .obsidian file in Obsidian.
2. You are strongly recommended to use Obsidian to read my notes for a reading experience that is closer to mine. My obsidian styles are all in the _obsidian folder, as emphasized in the first point.
